<h2> WEB </h2>
<p> The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is
   an information system where documents and other web resour
   ces are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs, such
    as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyp
    rlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2] The res
    ources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfe
    r Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software ap
    plication called a web browser, and are published by a softw
    are application called a web server. The World Wide Web is no
    t synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some
     form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web
     is built.
